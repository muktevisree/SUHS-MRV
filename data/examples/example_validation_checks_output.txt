[OK] facility_timeseries.csv found (shape: 10950 rows × 14 columns)
[OK] cycle_summary.csv found (shape: 360 rows × 11 columns)

File-level checks
-----------------
[OK] facility_metadata.csv is non-empty
[OK] facility_timeseries.csv is non-empty
[OK] cycle_summary.csv is non-empty

Schema & type checks
--------------------
[OK] facility_metadata.csv has expected columns:
     facility_id, facility_name, facility_type, country_code,
     latitude, longitude, depth_m, cavern_volume_m3,
     working_gas_capacity_kg, reservoir_type, start_date, end_date

[OK] facility_timeseries.csv has expected columns:
     timestamp, facility_id, h2_injected_kg, h2_withdrawn_kg,
     working_gas_kg, static_losses_kg, dynamic_losses_kg,
     h2_inlet_purity_pct, h2_outlet_purity_pct, h2_working_purity_pct,
     pressure_mpa, temperature_c, mass_balance_residual, mode

[OK] cycle_summary.csv has expected columns:
     facility_id, cycle_index, cycle_start, cycle_end,
     total_injected_kg, total_withdrawn_kg, total_losses_kg,
     avg_pressure_mpa, avg_temperature_c, cycle_efficiency, mode

Facility ID consistency
-----------------------
Unique facilities in metadata   : 15
Unique facilities in timeseries : 15
Unique facilities in cycles     : 15

[OK] All facility_id values in facility_metadata.csv are present in facility_timeseries.csv
[OK] All facility_id values in facility_metadata.csv are present in cycle_summary.csv

MRV mass-balance residuals
--------------------------
mass_balance_residual (timeseries):

count    1.0950e+04
mean     2.3e-07
std      7.5e-06
min     -3.6e-05
25%     -2.1e-06
50%      1.2e-07
75%      2.4e-06
max      4.1e-05

Max |mass_balance_residual|  : 4.1e-05
Rows with |residual| > 1e-03 : 0
Rows with |residual| > 5e-03 : 0

[OK] Residuals within expected bounds for synthetic MRV dataset

Purity & physical ranges
------------------------
h2_inlet_purity_pct:
    min=98.50, max=99.99, <90%: 0, >100%: 0
h2_outlet_purity_pct:
    min=97.80, max=99.95, <90%: 0, >100%: 0
h2_working_purity_pct:
    min=97.40, max=99.90, <90%: 0, >100%: 0

[OK] All purity values lie in a physically reasonable band (97–100%)

Pressure & temperature sanity checks
------------------------------------
pressure_mpa:
    min=4.5, max=23.8
temperature_c:
    min=18.2, max=62.7

[OK] No negative or zero pressures
[OK] Temperatures within expected geothermal envelope for UHS caverns

Cycle-level aggregates
----------------------
Number of cycles in cycle_summary.csv : 360

cycle_efficiency:
    min=0.91, max=0.99, mean=0.96

[OK] Cycle efficiencies mostly between 0.9 and 1.0

Overall status
--------------
All core validation checks completed successfully.

RESULT: PASS (SUHS-MRV v2.0 dataset is internally consistent and ready for use)
