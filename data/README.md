# SUHS-MRV Data Layout

This folder contains all dataset files for the **SUHS-MRV (Synthetic Underground Hydrogen Storage – MRV)** project.

Version: v2.0  
Last Updated: 2025-11-30

## 1. Directory Structure

- `generated/`  
  Contains full synthetic dataset outputs generated by `src/generator.py`.

- `examples/`  
  Holds small sliced subsets of the dataset for tutorials, demos, and unit tests.

- `raw/` *(optional)*  
  Reserved for future reference/seed data if needed.

## 2. Generated Dataset Files

When you run:

```bash
python -m src.generator

the following CSVs appear under data/generated/:

**1. facility_metadata.csv**

One row per UHS facility, including:
	•	facility_id
	•	geographic location
	•	depth, reservoir temperature, reservoir pressure
	•	storage type and working gas capacity
	•	porosity/permeability (if applicable)
	•	operational envelope parameters

**2. facility_timeseries.csv**

A multi-timestamp operational record per facility:
	•	timestamp
	•	h2_injected_kg / h2_withdrawn_kg
	•	working_gas_kg
	•	static_losses_kg / dynamic_losses_kg
	•	h2_working_purity_pct / h2_inlet_purity_pct / h2_outlet_purity_pct
	•	pressure_mpa / temperature_c
	•	mass_balance_residual

**3. cycle_summary.csv**

Summaries per operational cycle:
	•	cycle_start / cycle_end
	•	injected, withdrawn, and total losses
	•	average temperature and pressure
	•	cycle efficiency indicators

Full column-level definitions are in:
	•	docs/data_dictionary.md
	•	docs/schema_mapping_ofp_osdu.md

**3. How to Regenerate the Dataset**

The outputs are completely reproducible.

run..

pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m src.generator

Configuration (facility count, time range, frequency, physics settings) is controlled by:
config/uhs_config.yaml

**4. Example Data Subsets**

The folder:
data/examples/
is for small CSV slices such as:
	•	One facility’s timeseries for a short period
	•	A few example cycles
	•	A small metadata sample

These help with documentation, demos, workshops, or tests.
All example files must retain the same column names as the full dataset.
