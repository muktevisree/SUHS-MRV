# Methods, QA & Validation (UHS)

- Mass balance: `net = injected − withdrawn − losses ≥ 0` (enforced).
- Transport coherence: non-pipeline ⇒ `pipeline_length_km=0`.
- Leak logic: 0 events ⇒ 0 leak mass; events>0 ⇒ leak mass >0.
- Reservoir logic: salt cavern (low losses, high cycling), depleted gas (moderate losses, methane possible), saline aquifer (pilot, higher uncertainty).
- Energy intensity: compression energy / tonne-cycle ∈ [0.1, 0.5] MWh/t-cycle.
- Additivity: daily & monthly sums equal annual totals.
- Geo/date integrity: US bounds; dates within 2024.
